# Analysis of the Election Audit 

## Overview of the Election Audit 
In this election audit, we are helping Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee audit a recent US congressional election in Colorado.  We were tasked with reporting the: 

- total number of votes cast 
- the voter turnout for each county
- the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- the county with the highest turnout 
- total number of votes for each candidate 
- the percentage of votes for each candidate 
- the winner based on popular vote 

Instead of using Excel, we are writing code in Python to automate our results for future congressional districts. The plan is to: 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Find the voter turnout for each county
3. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county 
4. Determine the largest county turnout 
5. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
6. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
8. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
